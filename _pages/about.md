Welcome to my personal academic website! I'm delighted to have you here and share a bit about myself. I am a passionate junior scholar and lifelong learner, eager to explore and contribute to the ever-evolving world of fluid dynamics. I leave you with a beautiful quote by Anton Flettner. "_The treasures of the world of fluids will not disappoint the persistent explorer_"

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Universidad de Oriente (Venezuela) in 2019, where I developed a strong foundation in the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. During my time there I started to dive in the world of academic research by studying the formation and behavior of secondary flows in pipe-bends using a comercial CFD solver. Later, in 2021 I obtained a Master's degree in n Aerospace Engineering from Old Dominion University (USA), where I worked as a graduate assintant. Here I explored the behavior of vortex pairs as aircraft trailing vortices using theoretical frameworks and experimental data, under the supervision of [Dr. Robert L Ash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HWm5NQYAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University studying atmospheric turbulence behavior over offshore wind farms using Large Eddy Simulations (LES). My academic advisors are [Dr. Dennice Gayme](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/dennice-gayme/) and [Dr. Charles Meneveau](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/charles-meneveau/).
